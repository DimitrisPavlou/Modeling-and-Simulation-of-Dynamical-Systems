# System Identification and Adaptive Control Suite

This repository contains a three-part project focused on the modeling, estimation, and robust control of dynamic systems. The work progresses from offline statistical analysis to real-time adaptive architectures designed to handle uncertainty and disturbances.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to bridge the gap between theoretical system modeling and practical control implementation. It is divided into three core modules:

1. **Offline Estimation** – Statistical parameter identification  
2. **Online Estimation** – Real-time tracking using Lyapunov-based topologies  
3. **Robust Adaptive Control** – Advanced MRAC with leakage modifications

## 📂 Project Modules

### Part 1: Offline Parameter Estimation

Focused on identifying the constant parameters of a system using batch input–output data.

- **Methodology:**  
  Least Squares (LS) Estimation

- **Key Learning:**  
  - Implementation of the Normal Equations to minimize the sum of squared residuals  
  - Verification of the *Persistence of Excitation* condition

### Part 2: Online Parameter Estimation

Transition to recursive estimation for real-time applications where parameters may be time-varying.

- **Algorithms:**  
  Gradient Descent–based estimation laws  

- **Topologies:**  
  - **Parallel:**  
    The model runs independently of the plant.  

  - **Series–Parallel:**  
    Uses plant state feedback within the estimation model to improve convergence speed and stability.  

- **Stability Analysis:**  
  Estimation laws are designed using Lyapunov stability theory to ensure asymptotic convergence of the tracking error  
  (`e(t) → 0 as t → ∞`).

### Part 3: Robust Adaptive Control

Development of a Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) system engineered to remain stable in the presence of bounded disturbances and unmodeled dynamics.

- **Controller Design:**  
  Adaptive laws for plant tracking  

- **Robustness Modifications:**  
  - **σ-modification:**  
    Introduces a leakage term to the adaptive law to prevent parameter drift during periods of low excitation.  

  - **ε-modification:**  
    An adaptive leakage variation where the damping term is scaled by the magnitude of the tracking error.
